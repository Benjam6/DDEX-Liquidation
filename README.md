# DDEX Liquidation Bot

Participate in the liquidation on DDEX to earn money ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

## Getting Started

Margin positions will be liquidated if the collateral rate too low. 
When a liquidation occurs, the borrowers' assets are sold off in a form of a dutch auction to repay the loan. 
This bot help you bid the auction when profitable.

The bot uses an arbitrage strategy: Sell collateral on DDEX immediately after receive it from an auction. For example:

 - An auction sell *10ETH* at price *160USDT*
 - The bot buy *10ETH*
 - The bot sell *10ETH* on ddex at price *170USDT*
 - Earn *100USDT*
